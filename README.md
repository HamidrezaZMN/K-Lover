# What-Is-K-Lover
A k lover number is a number that the divisions of its digits repetition can be k.<br>
For example: 2552515<br>
This number has 4 fives and 2 twos.<br>
So it's 2 lover (4/2=2)

# How-Does-It-Work
You can simply run the exe file or compile&run the cpp file and see the results.<br>
First you enter a number, then the k you want to check.<br>
Then it says if the given number is k lover then prints all the ks.
